# Sample Kotlin SpringBoot

**Sample code to showcase a SpringBoot Web+JPA project tested with TestContainers**

Status        | Description
 ------------- | ------------- 
**STATUS**    | _Under Construction_
**STRATEGY**  | _Spike working example_


## Design

**Minimal code to be used for tutorial/brown-bag with Java developers already familiar with Java SpringBoot**


## Getting started

* `mvn clean install`
* run `ApplicationTest`

### Prerequisites

* Make sure your Docker engine is running `docker ps` (required for TestContainers to work)


## Handover Suggestions

_Nuggets of Knowledge and Thinking from last people to work on the project._
_e.g. suggestions for technical debt reduction, simplification or enhancements_

* Make it so you can run the Application itself, not just tests, perhaps assuming Postgres is started via Docker externally
